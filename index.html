    <h2>
      6 - 7th grade
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had inklings of doubt in my straight hood back in 7th grade, possibly 6th grade as well. I distinctly remember googling sexualities where you "want to date men, but not have sex with them." I suspect this lack of wanting to engage in coitus with men is due, at least in part, to my experience with my father. I believe he could've indirectly caused a negative association with men in general, and I feel I mostly got past that. However, I don't believe I have gotten past that sexual part, though, based on certain dreams I've had, I'd say it's gotten significantly better.

    <h2>
      First parts of 8th grade
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the first half of the 8th grade, based entirely in my mom's personal imagination (I love you mama, but that was definitely what this was), I believed I had a crush on Levi Ray Peterson at Stephen F Austin Middle School. I actually ended up playing "Gay Chicken" with him under a test table for our LEGO EV3 projects in our Robotics 1 class. I remember thinking "I should want this, and I know I like men. I saw this one Reddit post where a gay guy kicked ass at Gay Chicken, why can't I?" I did indeed "kick ass" at Gay Chicken, beating Levi 3/3 times we played. My strategy was to move so fast that either he couldn't process that he lost, and I guaranteed I had my first kiss with a cool guy, or I won. The first outcome didn't end up occurring, I just won each time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So yeah, W. Also this occurred at lunch, not during class. My robotics teacher, Mr. David Ross Baldridge, would've killed me. And he likely heard about this incident, and it also likely fueled his suspicion that I was not a Cisgender-Heterosexual male. I asked him during the Texas TSA's 2024 State Conference if he knew that Levi and I were both straight (I wasn't aware that I wasn't straight at the time), and he said he genuinely had no idea. He couldn't tell if we were joking or not. I don't know how this made him feel, but if he was homophobic, he is the kind of homophobic I prefer most: the type of homophobic where you don't agree with homosexuality on a fundamental level, but don't let this disagreement leak into personal relations in a negative manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revealing non-existent feelings for Levi would've been horribly awkward, since I had a form of power over him at the time. I was the lead coder in every project I was a part of, making me a kind of boss for him in every project we did together. As well, we were on a TSA MS Electrical Applications team, in which I knew the material best. Now I would never use that relative power over him, with or without malicious intent, and realistically he wouldn't let me.

      Later parts of 8th grade
    </h2>
    <p>
      A month or two later, Victoria Lin Lee Shannon Romero, a close friend of mine for 2 years at this point, told me that Tyson Lucas Strong, a close friend of mine for the entirety of the school year at this point, had told her about a new crush he had. I, a tea-loving gaybie, asked her to "spill the tea." She refused initially, before telling me that he was bisexual, and had a crush on Benjamin Basile, a fellow student in SFA's Odyssey Academy (A 3 year program from 5th to 8th grade that all my friends and I went through). I told him later that day that I knew who his crush was, and he seemed to slightly panic inside before I told him I knew his crush to be Benjamin "Ben" Basile; he seemed to calm down after hearing this. I found out why a few months later, in May of 2024.

    <h2>
      Texas TSA 2024 State Conference
    </h2>
    <p>
      In April of 2024, Tyson Lucas Strong (TSA MS Forensic Technology competitor), Thomas Luke Odeski, a very very good friend of mine for the entirety of the school year at this point (TSA MS Coding competitor, as well as a critical member on my SeaPerch team), Joseph Cotton (TSA MS Coding competitor), Hannah "Kai" McKinley, also a very good friend of mine (TSA MS Forensic Technology competitor), Levi Ray Peterson (TSA MS Electrical Applications competitor), Shelby (TSA MS Career Prep competitor), and myself (TSA MS Electrical Applications competitor) departed from SFA with our advisor, Mr. Baldridge, for Texas TSA's 2024 State Conference. At this conference, Luke, Tyson, Kai, and myself bonded even more than we had before.
The rooming arrangements for the 4 day conference were as follows:
Boys room 1: Tyson, Levi, Joseph
Boys room 2: Luke, Graer
Girls room 1: Kai, Shelby
    </p>
    <p>
      During this conference, I myself start suffering from noticeable symptoms from severe stress. I had never done TSA before, and it was affecting me deeply. My personality temporarily changed for certain hours of certain days of the conference. I ended up bombarding Luke with Welch's Fruit Snacks whilst he was calling his girlfriend, Averie Clements. I ended up leaving my room, and walked into Boys room 1 bearing my fruit snacks. I teamed up with Levi to bombard Tyson with pillows and fruit snacks, this affected him deeply. He later told me that he had "never seen me act so cruel and vicious." I ended up giving him, what I thought was a poor apology, an incredible apology in his eyes, one of the best apologies he had ever heard at the time. he was furious with me for the entire day, and told Luke he wouldn't talk to me until I apologized, and asked Luke to make sure I did.
I made the move to apologize around 11PM that night (I knew he would be awake because he had mentioned the day before that Boys room 1 was awake until midnight talking), Luke noting that he was supposed to make sure I apologized, but apparently I made the move to do so without prodding or leading (Go me).
It was in this conversation that Tyson told me he was gay, and that his parents were unsupportive.
