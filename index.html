      I had inklings of doubt in my straight hood back in 7th grade, possibly 6th grade as well. I distinctly remember googling sexualities where you "want to date men, but not have sex with them." I suspect this lack of wanting to engage in coitus with men is due, at least in part, to my experience with my father. I believe he could've indirectly caused a negative association with men in general, and I feel I mostly got past that. However, I don't believe I have gotten past that sexual part, though, based on certain dreams I've had, I'd say it's gotten significantly better.
