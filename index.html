    <h2>
      6 - 7th grade
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had inklings of doubt in my straight hood back in 7th grade, possibly 6th grade as well. I distinctly remember googling sexualities where you "want to date men, but not have sex with them." I suspect this lack of wanting to engage in coitus with men is due, at least in part, to my experience with my father. I believe he could've indirectly caused a negative association with men in general, and I feel I mostly got past that. However, I don't believe I have gotten past that sexual part, though, based on certain dreams I've had, I'd say it's gotten significantly better.

    <h2>
      First parts of 8th grade
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the first half of the 8th grade, based entirely in my mom's personal imagination (I love you mom, but that was definitely what this was), I believed I had a crush on Levi Ray Peterson at Stephen F Austin Middle School. I actually ended up playing "Gay Chicken" with him under a test table for our LEGO EV3 projects in our Robotics 1 class. I remember thinking "I should want this, and I know I like men. I saw this one Reddit post where a gay guy kicked ass at Gay Chicken, why can't I?" I did indeed "kick ass" at Gay Chicken, beating Levi 3/3 times we played. My strategy was to move so fast that either he couldn't process that he lost, and I guaranteed I had my first kiss with a cool guy, or I won. The first outcome didn't end up occurring, I just won each time.

    <p>
      So yeah, W. Also this occurred at lunch, not during class. My robotics teacher, Mr. David Ross Baldridge, would've killed me. And he likely heard about this incident, and it also likely fueled his suspicion that I was not a Cisgender-Heterosexual male. I asked him during the Texas TSA's 2024 State Conference if he knew that Levi and I were both straight (I wasn't aware that I wasn't straight at the time), and he said he genuinely had no idea. He couldn't tell if we were joking or not. I don't know how this made him feel, but if he was homophobic, he is the kind of homophobic I prefer most: the type of homophobic where you don't agree with homosexuality on a fundamental level, but don't let this disagreement leak into personal relations in a negative manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revealing non-existent feelings for Levi would've been horribly awkward, since I had a form of power over him at the time. I was the lead coder in every project I was a part of, making me a kind of boss for him in every project we did together. As well, we were on a TSA MS Electrical Applications team, in which I knew the material best. Now I would never use that relative power over him, with or without malicious intent, and realistically he wouldn't let me.
